# Leap_Year_Checker
This is a program coded in Python that takes year as input and outputs whether the entered year is a leap year or not.

This program is mainly coded for my own learning purposes. Here, I used Tkinter module to make the GUI for the program.

I also used tkinter.messagebox to display popup error message for inputs that are not of integer datatype.

## Challenges faced:

* Connecting backend with the frontend

* Positioning the labels and widgets and the confusion of using pack(), place() and other methods

* Connecting the function itself to the tkinter widgets

## Technologies used:
* Tkinter module

* tkinter.messagebox

## What I have learnt?

The GUI modules for Python are totally unreliable and outdated despite being so easy to use. Using a framework like React, Vue or Angular is a way better option for GUIs.

## How to use this project?

You can use this project in anyway you want. This is only coded for learning purposes. I am not going to do anything else with this project.
